I am a Research Fellow in Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS) in Singapore. I completed my Ph.D. at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) supervised by Zhenzhen Yan and received my Bachelor Degree at Tsinghua University. You can find my CV here: [Zihao Li's CV](../assets/resume_ZihaoLi.pdf).

My research interests lie in online resource allocation and revenue management, including online matching and online generalized assignment problem. I am also interested in the fairness and efficiency issues in fair division.
